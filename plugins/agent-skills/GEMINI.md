# Agent Skills — Gemini CLI

Behavioral guardrails for AI coding agents. Each skill in `skills/` targets a specific agent failure mode with a step-by-step process grounded in industry practices (Microsoft, Google, Stripe, Netflix).

## Critical Skills (apply always)

- **scope-discipline** — Do exactly what was asked. No extra features, no unsolicited refactors
- **incremental-implementation** — Never write more than 50 lines without running tests
