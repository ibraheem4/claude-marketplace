# Agent Skills

Behavioral guardrails and engineering workflows for AI coding agents. Each skill combats a specific agent failure mode — scope creep, blind retries, missing tests, hallucinated fixes — with step-by-step processes grounded in industry practices.

Draws from [Microsoft's Engineering Playbook](https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/), [Google's SWE Book](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book), [Stripe's API design](https://stripe.com/docs/api), and [Netflix's resilience engineering](https://netflixtechblog.com/).

## Why Agent-Specific Skills?

AI agents fail differently than humans:

| Agent Failure Mode | Human Equivalent | Skill That Fixes It |
|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Writes 500 lines without testing | Cowboy coding | [incremental-implementation](#build) |
| Retries the same failing approach | Stubbornness | `superpowers:systematic-debugging` |
| Adds features nobody asked for | Scope creep | [scope-discipline](#build) |
| Generates code with subtle security holes | Inexperience | [security-and-hardening](#review) |
| Leaves debug logs and TODOs in code | Carelessness | [shipping-and-launch](#ship) |
| Doesn't read existing code before editing | Arrogance | [code-review-and-quality](#review) |
| Over-engineers with premature abstractions | Resume-driven dev | [code-health-and-maintainability](#review) |
| Ignores error messages, guesses at fixes | Panic | `superpowers:systematic-debugging` |
| Deletes a repo that had unpushed work | Carelessness | [safe-repo-removal](#operate) |
| Kills a process that immediately respawns | Whack-a-mole | [find-hidden-services](#operate) |
| Reads the biggest log first | Chasing noise | [triage-failing-fleet](#operate) |
| Deletes committed files as "build output" | Overreach | [disk-reclaim](#operate) |
| Hardcodes one company into a reusable skill | Short-termism | [work-summary](#operate) |
| Calls unread mail a to-do list | Mistaking volume for signal | [work-queue](#operate) |

## Skills

### Build
- **[incremental-implementation](skills/incremental-implementation/)** — Never write more than 50 lines without running tests. Commit after every working change. *[Google: small CLs; Microsoft: atomic commits]*
- **[scope-discipline](skills/scope-discipline/)** — Surface assumptions, then do exactly what was asked. No extra features, no unsolicited improvements. *[Google: one logical change per CL]*
- **[api-and-interface-design](skills/api-and-interface-design/)** — Design the interface before the implementation. Consistent naming, minimal surface area, hard to misuse. *[Stripe: resource-oriented design, consistent error structure]*
- **[context-engineering](skills/context-engineering/)** — Read before writing, load deliberately, verify don't assume. Manage what enters the context window. *[Agent-specific]*
- **[agent-instruction-files](skills/agent-instruction-files/)** — One instruction file per repo and per user, reached from each CLI's documented path by symlink or import. Never `~/AGENTS.md`. *[Agent-specific]*

### Verify
- **[verify-before-cite](skills/verify-before-cite/)** — A document is a claim, not evidence. Check the path, role or resource lives before following or repeating it. *[Agent-specific]*
- **[false-verification-signals](skills/false-verification-signals/)** — A cached run is a replay, a sandboxed probe is about the sandbox, and zero rows can mean no scope. Confirm the check ran. *[Agent-specific]*
- **[performance-optimization](skills/performance-optimization/)** — Measure first, optimize the bottleneck, verify the improvement. Never optimize without profiling data. *[Google: measure-first; Stripe: latency budgets]*

### Review
- **[code-review-and-quality](skills/code-review-and-quality/)** — Two-pass review: design pass, then code quality pass. Label findings by severity. *[Microsoft: two-pass model; Google: readability reviews]*
- **[security-and-hardening](skills/security-and-hardening/)** — DevSecOps shift-left checks: input validation, auth, secrets, dependencies. *[Microsoft: SDL; OWASP Top 10]*
- **[threat-modeling](skills/threat-modeling/)** — STRIDE threat analysis on data flow diagrams. Identify threats at design time, not after deployment. *[Microsoft: SDL]*
- **[code-health-and-maintainability](skills/code-health-and-maintainability/)** — Remove dead code. Improve names. Reduce nesting. Three similar lines are better than one wrong abstraction. *[Google: readability; Microsoft: code health]*

### Ship
- **[shipping-and-launch](skills/shipping-and-launch/)** — Pre-flight checklist: tests pass, no secrets, no debug logs, no TODOs without tickets. *[Microsoft: Engineering Fundamentals Checklist]*
- **[git-workflow-and-versioning](skills/git-workflow-and-versioning/)** — Conventional commits, branch naming, semantic versioning. Every commit compiles and passes tests. *[Google: trunk-based development]*
- **[review-response](skills/review-response/)** — Address every review comment: fix, acknowledge, or explain. Batch fixes, reply individually, resolve threads. *[Google: review turnaround]*
- **[pr-lifecycle](skills/pr-lifecycle/)** — Shepherd a PR to merge-readiness: monitor CI, fix failures, handle feedback, loop until green. Never merge automatically. *[Microsoft/Google: CI gates]*

### Operate

- **[graceful-degradation](skills/graceful-degradation/)** — Every external call needs a timeout. Classify dependencies as critical or optional. Degrade, don't crash. *[Netflix: Hystrix, circuit breakers]*
- **[observability-and-monitoring](skills/observability-and-monitoring/)** — Structured logs, RED metrics, correlation IDs. Ship monitoring with the feature. *[Google: SRE]*
- **[session-handoff](skills/session-handoff/)** — Write a continuation prompt a cold session can act on: absolute paths, real shas, verified vs assumed, one next step. Closing a session also updates tickets, the system of record and internal and external docs, then lints. *[Agent-specific]*
- **[work-summary](skills/work-summary/)** — Summarize one workspace's activity for any period across ten sources and post it. Profile-driven. *[Agent-specific]*
- **[work-queue](skills/work-queue/)** — The inverse: what is owed, not what is done. Nine sources into six ranked bands. Read-only, profile-driven. *[Agent-specific]*

### Foundations
- **[agent-operating-principles](skills/agent-operating-principles/)** — Core behaviors: surface assumptions, stop when confused, don't be sycophantic, admit uncertainty. *[Agent-specific]*
- **[skill-authoring](skills/skill-authoring/)** — Create and revise reusable skills: the contract, the invariants, and a validator. *[Agent-specific]*
- **[engineering-fundamentals-checklist](skills/engineering-fundamentals-checklist/)** — Sprint 0 setup: CI, tests, branch protection, security scanning, monitoring. *[Microsoft: Engineering Fundamentals Playbook]*

## Split out of this repository

Three groups left this repo when it reached 49 skills, which is more descriptions than any one
selection context should carry. Each is a plugin of its own:

| Plugin | Covers |
|---|---|
| [frontend-skills](https://github.com/ibraheem4/frontend-skills) | UI engineering, accessibility, Tailwind v4, component reference, scroll motion |
| [infra-skills](https://github.com/ibraheem4/infra-skills) | AWS, GCP, DNS, mail auth, SSO, OAuth providers, preview environments, and workstation operations |
| [delivery-skills](https://github.com/ibraheem4/delivery-skills) | Deploy, QA, release — and the governance chains: trust review and the shape → orient → implement → review → release pipeline |

What stays here is the part that applies whatever you are building: how to work, what to check,
and what to refuse.

## Skills we deliberately do not ship

Another plugin already does it better. Adopting beats duplicating: two skills matching the
same trigger means unpredictable selection, and the weaker one wins half the time.

| Not here | Use instead | Why |
|---|---|---|
| test-driven-development | `superpowers:test-driven-development` | 320 lines to our 128, with an explicit *verify-RED / verify-GREEN* step ours lacked. Our Google test-size classification survives in `engineering-fundamentals-checklist` |
| debugging-and-error-recovery | `superpowers:systematic-debugging` | Four phases with root-cause investigation and pattern analysis, against our six linear steps |

Checked and **kept** rather than deferred, because the overlap was apparent and not real:

- `review-response` — `superpowers:receiving-code-review` covers judgment (when to push back,
  forbidden responses); ours covers thread hygiene (reply to every comment, resolve threads)
- `frontend-ui-engineering` — `frontend-design` is 71 lines of aesthetic direction; ours is
  engineering plus accessibility, components, responsive and data-viz references
- `false-verification-signals` — `superpowers:verification-before-completion` is the
  first-order rule (run it, read it, then claim). Ours is the second-order one: six cases
  where you did run it, did read it, and were still deceived

## Design Philosophy

1. **Agent failure modes, not human advice** — Each skill targets a specific way agents break
2. **Process over prose** — Step-by-step workflows, not knowledge dumps
3. **Anti-rationalization** — Common excuses for skipping steps with factual rebuttals
4. **Industry-grounded** — Every practice is cited to a public engineering playbook or book
5. **Tool-agnostic core** — Skills work across Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI
