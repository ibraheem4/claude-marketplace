# agent-skills - Codex Instructions

Behavioral guardrails for AI coding agents. Each skill in `skills/` targets a specific agent failure mode with a step-by-step process grounded in industry practices (Microsoft, Google, Stripe, Netflix).

## Critical Skills (apply always)

- **scope-discipline** — Do exactly what was asked. No extra features, no unsolicited refactors
- **incremental-implementation** — Never write more than 50 lines without running tests

## Available Skills

- `/build` — Implement in small, tested increments
- `/scope` — Check your diff against the request — remove anything unsolicited
- `/review` — Two-pass review: design pass, then code quality
- `/secure` — Security checklist: inputs, auth, secrets, dependencies
- `/ship` — Pre-flight: tests pass, no secrets, no debug logs, no naked TODOs
- `/resilience` — Timeouts, circuit breakers, fallbacks for external calls
- `/cleanup-repo` — Prove commits are recoverable before deleting a repo (five checks, manifest, bundle)
- `/find-services` — Enumerate every spawner: launchd, native-messaging hosts, MCP configs
- `/triage-fleet` — Distinct-line collapse, then walk the dependency chain to the upstream cause
- `/reclaim-disk` — Caches before working trees; check for tracked files before deleting `dist/`
- `/work-summary` — Summarize a workspace's activity for any period and post it (profile-driven)
- `/work-queue` — What's owed across nine sources, ranked into six bands; read-only (profile-driven)
- `/verify-signals` — A cached run is a replay; a sandboxed probe is about the sandbox; zero rows can mean no scope
- `/handoff` — Continuation prompt a cold session can act on: absolute paths, real shas, one next step; closing updates tickets, docs and the record, then lints
- `/cite-check` — A document is a claim, not evidence. Verify the path, role or resource exists
- `/instruction-files` — One file for Claude, Codex, Gemini and Goose, linked or imported from each tool's documented path
- `/bringup` — Cold clone to a running app; the bar is a status code and a screenshot
- `/aws` — Pin the AZ, delegate subdomains, verify the deploy role against live IAM
- `/preview-env` — Per-PR preview environments: label-gated spin-up, a database per PR, bounded OIDC roles, a teardown that cannot lie
- `/oauth-providers` — WorkOS social sign-in: a secret shown once, and two provider gates that reject sign-ins your credentials had nothing to do with

## Codex Operating Notes

- Treat this repository as independent from any surrounding multi-repo workspace unless a task explicitly spans several repos.
- Check `git status --short` before editing and do not revert user changes.
- Prefer the repo's documented commands and existing patterns over introducing new tooling.
- Run the smallest useful verification for the files changed and report anything that could not be run.
- Never commit secrets, environment files, tokens, or generated credentials.
