name: work-queue
description: Use when asked "what should I work on", "what's on my plate", "what's assigned to me", or for a to-do list gathered from every channel. Sweeps Linear, GitHub, mail, chat, meetings and local work-in-progress for one workspace, then ranks what is owed into six bands. Read-only by default; can also find tickets that finished but were never closed and close them one at a time on explicit confirmation. The inverse of work-summary, which reports what is already done.

# Work Queue

## Overview

Gather everything one person owes across up to nine sources, rank it, and print it. Every
workspace-specific value lives in a profile file, so the same skill serves any company.

`work-summary` is the other half of the pair. It reports what closed; this reports what is
open. The boundary is one rule in both directions: **done belongs to work-summary, owed
belongs here.** A completed item is never a queue item, however recently it closed.

Both halves share one interface, so either can be called the same way:

- **A bare call always works.** No argument is required by either skill, ever.
- **The period is optional** and uses the same words in both: `last week`, `since Tuesday`,
  `30 days`, `2026-09-01`.
- **The header states what was covered** — scope, window, and any source that failed.
- **Every run is logged** to `{{work_log_dir}}`, so both can answer questions about the past.
  See `references/run-log.md`, which both skills write.

## When to Use

- "What should I work on", "what's on my plate", "what am I on the hook for"
- A to-do list assembled from Linear, GitHub, mail, chat and meetings
- Picking work back up after time away

**Do not use** to summarize finished work, to build someone else's queue, or to mix two
workspaces into one list — one profile per run.

## Read-only, and the one exception

**A bare call never writes.** It does not file tickets, reply to anyone, move a Linear issue,
or comment on a PR. Two reasons, both load-bearing: a queue that infers must not also act on
its inferences, and read-only is what makes it safe to run several times a day. Acting on an
item is a separate request the person makes after reading the list.

The single exception is **closing a ticket that already finished** — `--close`, step 13. It
exists because a stale-open ticket is a defect in this skill's own output rather than a piece
of work, and because nobody else is going to notice. It is fenced so it cannot become an
inference that acts:

- It never runs on a bare call. `--close` is required, every time.
- It closes **one ticket per explicit confirmation**, never a batch, and never a second one
  inferred from the first yes.
- It only ever sets a status and adds a comment saying why. No reassigning, relabelling, or
  moving projects.
- Detection itself stays read-only, so the finding is available on every run whether or not
  anyone acts on it.

`references/already-done.md` carries the evidence ranking, the scope rule, and the confirmation
protocol. Read it before using `--close`.

## Step 0 — load the profile

All workspace-specific values live in a profile, never in this file.

1. If the caller named a workspace, read `~/<workspace>/.claude/*.config.md`.
2. Otherwise glob `~/*/.claude/*.config.md`. Exactly one workspace matches — use it. Several —
   list them and ask. None — stop and say a profile must be created, and point at
   `references/profile-example.md`, which is the template to create it from.

A workspace may carry several profile files with separate contracts; a key defined by any of
them resolves. **If two profiles define the same key with different values, stop and report
the drift** instead of picking one. That divergence silently changes what the sweep covers,
and it is the defect this skill is most likely to inherit.

Keys read: `{{workspace_root}}`, `{{github_login}}`, `{{github_org}}`, `{{exclude_orgs}}`,
`{{linear_teams}}`, `{{linear_user}}`, `{{work_channels}}`, `{{transcript_glob}}`,
`{{work_log_dir}}`.

## Step 1 — set the scope

**No date argument is ever required.** Running the skill bare is the normal case. If the
caller gave no period, do not ask for one — pick the defaults below and say which you used.

**Scope.** The default sweep is **tiers 1-2** — tracker, GitHub, mail, chat and meetings. Those
carry real assignments and finish fast enough to run before standup. `--full` adds **tiers 3-4**
— calendar, wiki and local work-in-progress. A session scan is slow; it earns its cost weekly,
not hourly.

**Meetings and chat are never optional.** Both run on every call, including a bare one.

- **Meetings** were tier 3 until 2026-09-08, which meant a default run never read them. That is
  backwards: meeting notes are usually the *only* source that produces a date, so the sweep that
  skipped them was the sweep most likely to miss the nearest deadline. A run that carried a date
  forward from a previous snapshot without re-reading the notes is reporting hearsay — it cannot
  tell you the date moved, or that the commitment was already discharged.
- **Chat** means every channel *and* every DM the person can read, threads included. Scoping it
  to a channel list was the same mistake in a different place: the ask that blocks someone is at
  least as likely to arrive in a DM as in `#dev`.

Neither may be dropped for being slow. If one fails, say so in the header — never let a silent
omission read as a quiet week.

**Window.** There are two kinds of source here, and only one of them has a window at all:

| Source kind | Window |
|---|---|
| **Assignments** — tracker issues, GitHub PRs and issues (tier 1) | **None, ever.** An issue assigned eight months ago is still owed. A window here silently drops the oldest and most neglected items, which are exactly the ones a queue exists to surface |
| **Asks** — chat, mail, tracker inbox, meetings (tiers 2-3) | `SINCE`, default **14 days**. An unanswered question older than that has usually died or been handled somewhere else |

An optional argument overrides `SINCE` and nothing else: a date, `last week`, `since Tuesday`,
`30 days`. Resolve it with `date` — never compute a date in your head — and state the window
in the output header so the reader knows what was covered.

```bash
date -j -v-14d +%F     # default SINCE
```

**Optional arguments.** All of them optional; the bare call is the one to optimise for.

| Argument | Effect |
|---|---|
| *(none)* | Default sweep — tracker, GitHub, mail, chat **and meetings** — `SINCE` 14 days, snapshot written |
| a period | Overrides `SINCE` only — never the assignment sources, which have no window, and never the meetings floor |
| `--full` | Adds tiers 3-4 — calendar, wiki, local work-in-progress |
| `--as-of <date>` | Prints the nearest snapshot at or before that date **instead of sweeping**. This is how the skill answers questions about past work |
| `--no-log` | Skips writing a snapshot. For a throwaway run that should not affect the next diff |
| `--close` | Runs step 13's confirmation loop, offering each already-done candidate one at a time. **The only argument that can write to the tracker.** Detection runs either way |

## Steps 2-10 — gather

Work through **`references/sources.md`**. Each source carries its query, its noise filter, and
what it is actually good for. Sources are independent: if one fails, record the failure, name
it in the output, and continue.

| # | Source | Tier | Yields |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | Tracker issues | 1 | The assigned queue — **every** team in `{{linear_teams}}` |
| 3 | Tracker inbox | 2 | Mentions, and comments on issues that are mine |
| 4 | GitHub | 1, 4 | Review requests of me; my own open PRs |
| 5 | Mail | 2 | Direct asks addressed to me |
| 6 | Chat | 2 | Unanswered @-mentions and DMs — **every channel and DM I can read** |
| 7 | Meetings | 2 | Commitments I made out loud — **and usually the only source of dates** |
| 8 | Calendar | 3 | What is imminent, and what needs preparing |
| 9 | Wiki and docs | 3 | Documents left awaiting my edit |
| 10 | Local work-in-progress | 4 | Unmerged branches, draft PRs, sessions that stopped mid-task |

**Every tier past 1 is inference.** Carry a confidence with each item and quote its evidence
verbatim, so a wrong guess costs one glance to reject instead of a click to investigate.

**Step 4 pays for itself twice.** The merged-PR half of the GitHub sweep is what step 13 reads
to find finished-but-open tickets, so scan merged PRs for tracker ids while you are already
there rather than querying GitHub a second time.

## Step 11 — diff against the last run, then rank and print

Read the most recent snapshot from `{{work_log_dir}}` **before printing**, and mark each item
`NEW` or `carried Nd` against it. Anything that disappeared goes in a short cleared line,
classified `done` or `aged out` — never conflated. `references/run-log.md` has the id scheme
and the classification rule.

The diff is what makes the queue a record rather than a snapshot: `carried 12d` on a two-line
task is the most actionable thing on the page, and no single sweep can produce it.

**Read the snapshot's `judgments` block in the same pass, and honor it.** An ask the person
answered out of band — verbally at a standup, on a call — is settled forever in their head and
unanswered forever in its source, so only the log can carry that. An item they re-ranked stays
where they put it until new evidence arrives. Both states are in `references/run-log.md`; a
sweep that ignores them re-surfaces the same two items every run and spends band 1, the only
band whose value is the reader's trust, arguing with the reader.

Then follow **`references/ranking.md`** for the six bands, the tie-breaks and the output shape.
In order: blocking someone, dated, stalled on someone else, in flight, assigned, inferred.

Two properties of a real queue that the ranking exists to handle: tracker priority is usually
flat — a queue where half the items are Urgent carries no signal — and dates usually live
somewhere other than the tracker. Rank on what is true, not on the priority field.

## Step 12 — record the run

Write today's snapshot to `{{work_log_dir}}/queue/`, in the format in `references/run-log.md`.
Carry `first_seen` forward for every item that survived; set it to today for anything `NEW`.

Apart from step 13's confirmed closes, this is the only write either skill performs, and it
stays inside `{{work_log_dir}}`. Skip it only for `--as-of` (which swept nothing) and
`--no-log`.

## Step 13 — already done, still open

Follow **`references/already-done.md`**. Two halves, and only the second one writes.

**Detection runs on every sweep.** Cross-reference the open tracker queue against the merged
PRs already gathered in step 4, rank each candidate by evidence strength, and print the result
as its own short section below the ranked queue — never mixed into the bands, because these are
not work. A candidate list is information even when nobody acts on it: it tells the reader the
queue above may be shorter than it looks.

Print at most the strong candidates and a count of the weak ones. If there are none, one line
saying so — that is a healthy queue, not a gap to fill.

**Closing needs `--close` and one confirmation per ticket.** Offer the strongest candidate
with its evidence and what closing would leave unfinished, then wait. A yes closes exactly that
ticket and adds a comment citing the evidence; anything else changes nothing. Then offer the
next one. Never batch, never generalize a yes, and stop as soon as the evidence goes weak.

Record both the closes and the declines in the run log, so the next run does not re-ask about a
ticket the person already said to leave alone.

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Why It's Wrong |
|--------|---------------|
| "It's assigned to me, so it belongs in the queue" | Assigned and closed is not owed. Filter by status type, not by assignee alone |
| "The profile names one team, so that's the team" | Teams get added. Read every team in `{{linear_teams}}`, and re-verify that list against the tracker when the queue looks thin |
| "Unread mail addressed to me is a to-do list" | It is mostly calendar invitations and automated notes. Without the exclusions in `references/sources.md` this tier returns almost no signal |
| "The notification inbox is the ask list" | A large share of notifications are project-metadata churn. Whitelist the types that mean someone wants something from you |
| "A mention is a request" | Most mentions are cc-and-FYI. A request carries a question mark or an imperative addressed to you |
| "More sources means a better queue" | Every source past tier 1 lowers precision. `--full` exists so the person chooses when to pay that |
| "Meetings are slow, and it's only a bare call" | Meetings run on every call. They are usually the only source of a date, so skipping them is how the nearest deadline goes missing |
| "The date is already in the last snapshot, I can carry it" | A carried date is hearsay. Re-read the notes: dates move, promises get discharged, and a second one can land on the same day |
| "The profile lists the work channels, so that's the chat scope" | Every channel *and* every DM. `{{work_channels}}` ranks results; it must never filter the search |
| "The search returned the message, so I've read the ask" | A hit is a message. Open the thread — the reply that asks you something usually doesn't repeat your name |
| "That link is just an announcement" | A document a colleague calls *the agreed flow* or *what's built and what isn't* is a source. Open it before ranking anything it covers |
| "The ticket says it's blocked, so it's blocked" | Issue text is written once and rarely revised. Check the stated blocker still holds before an item reaches the top three — twice in one run the blocker had already cleared |
| "I found 40 things, so I'll list 40" | A list nobody finishes is not a priority list. Rank, cut, and offer the tail |
| "The tracker says Urgent, so it ranks first" | Urgent is frequently applied to most of a queue. Something blocking a colleague outranks a flat priority flag |
| "I can close this one for them while I'm here" | A bare call is read-only. Closing needs `--close` **and** a confirmation for that specific ticket |
| "A merged PR mentions this ticket, so it's done" | The most common reason a PR names a ticket is to defer it — "out of scope here, its own ticket". Read the sentence around the id |
| "They said yes to the last three, so this one's fine" | One yes closes one ticket. The confirmation loop exists precisely because the fourth is the wrong one |
| "It's their own ticket and it looks finished — I'll just close it" | Looks-finished is the state this pass reports, never the state it acts on. The person supplies the certainty |
| "Closing it silently is cleaner than a comment" | A status change with no evidence is unreadable in three weeks, and on someone else's ticket it is unexplainable |
| "There are twelve candidates, I'll list them and ask once" | A list invites one blanket yes. One ticket per message |
| "No period was given, so I'll ask which one" | Bare invocation is the normal case. Assignments have no window and asks default to 14 days — state what you used and get on with it |
| "This issue is months old, it can't still be live" | Assignments never expire on age. That judgment belongs to the person reading the queue, not to the sweep |
| "It's gone from the queue, so it got done" | It may have aged out of `SINCE` without ever being answered. Classify against the window before claiming anything closed |
| "Slack still shows no reply, so the ask is still open" | Most asks that matter get answered in the standup five minutes later, and nothing gets typed. Check the `judgments` block before ranking an ask as blocking anyone |
| "They handled it verbally, so it's done" | The ask is discharged; the work it asked for usually is not. Drop the ask, keep the task, and say which is which |
| "The evidence clearly puts this in band 1" | It did last run too, and they moved it. An owner's band survives until new evidence arrives — re-deriving the old one is overruling them daily |
| "The ticket itself says they need that thing" | Issue text is written once. If the person says otherwise, rank where they put it and note the disagreement once |
| "There's no snapshot for that date, I'll just sweep and present it as that day" | A reconstructed past is a fabricated one. Say no snapshot exists |
| "I'll reset first_seen, the item looks different now" | `first_seen` is the age of the obligation, not of its wording. Resetting it hides exactly what the log is for |

## Red Flags

- Any workspace-specific literal in `SKILL.md` or `references/` instead of a profile key
- An item from an org in `{{exclude_orgs}}`, or from a tracker team outside `{{linear_teams}}`
- A dated item whose date came from a previous snapshot rather than from notes read this run
- An ask printed as unanswered that the log records as `discharged`
- An item re-ranked into the band the person moved it out of, on the same evidence
- A `discharged` or `ranked by owner` entry written from inference rather than from the person
  saying so
- A band 1-2 item whose urgency rests only on the ticket's own description of its blocker
- A chat sweep that searched only `{{work_channels}}`, or that skipped DMs
- A completed, merged or closed item presented as owed
- An inferred item shown without the quote it was inferred from
- Bot-authored PRs (dependency bumps) counted as review requests
- Any write outside `{{work_log_dir}}` other than a step-13 confirmed close: a reply, a filed
  ticket, a reassignment, a project move
- A tracker write on a bare call, or any close without a confirmation naming that ticket
- An already-done candidate outside the scope rule — not created by and not assigned to
  `{{linear_user}}`
- A standing-duty ticket, or a weak-evidence backlog ticket, offered as an already-done candidate
- A close whose only evidence is a bare id in a merged PR body
- A `cleared` item marked `done` when its timestamp merely fell outside `SINCE`
- A run log committed to git rather than ignored
- Printing a queue without naming the sources that failed

- [ ] Snapshot written to `{{work_log_dir}}`, with `first_seen` carried forward
- [ ] Already-done candidates printed as their own section, each with its evidence strength

      backlog ticket resting on weak evidence alone
- [ ] No tracker write happened unless `--close` was passed
- [ ] Every close was confirmed for that specific ticket, carries an evidence comment, and
      changed nothing but the status
- [ ] Declined candidates recorded in the run log so the next run does not re-ask
- [ ] Nothing else written to any system outside `{{work_log_dir}}`
