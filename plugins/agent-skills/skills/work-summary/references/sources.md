# Sources

Per-source gathering detail for `work-summary`, steps 2-11. Every `{{key}}` comes from the
profile resolved in step 0. Sources are independent - a failure in one does not block others;
record it and carry on.

## Step 2 — GitHub activity

**Short periods (roughly a week or less) — the events feed.** It is the richer source:
pushes, branch creations, and review comments only exist here.

```bash
gh api "users/{{github_login}}/events?per_page=100"
```

Filter to `created_at` within `START..END` AND `repo.name` starting `{{github_org}}/`. This
feed includes private-repo events because the call is authenticated as that user. It is
capped at roughly **300 events / 90 days** across three pages (`&page=2`, `&page=3`) — at their
current rate one page reached back 14 days and all three reached 30. Check the oldest
`created_at` you got back: **if it lands after `START`, the feed did not cover the period and
you must say so.**

**Longer periods — the PR search**, which is indexed rather than a rolling feed and does not
age out:

```bash
gh search prs --author {{github_login}} --owner {{github_org}} --created "$START..$END" \
  --json number,title,state,createdAt,repository --limit 100
gh search prs --author {{github_login}} --owner {{github_org}} --merged-at "$START..$END" \
  --json number,title,state,closedAt,repository --limit 100
```

Both were verified working. Two quirks: `mergedAt` is **not** an available `--json` field, so
use `closedAt` from the `--merged-at` query — for a merged PR they are the same timestamp
(checked against the PR API on #135/#136). And a PR opened before `START` and merged inside it
only appears in the second query, which is exactly why both run.

Pushes and review comments have no equivalent search, so for a long period they are
events-feed-only and simply unavailable past the cap. State that rather than implying the
period had no commits.

Report per repo: PRs opened / merged / closed (with numbers and titles), pushes (branch
+ commit count), branches created, review comments. Prefer PR titles over commit
messages — they read better and are already written for an audience.

One limit worth respecting rather than working around: `gh search commits` is **not** a
substitute for either query — its index lags and misses same-day work.

Merge attribution needs the PR API, not the events feed: a merge of *their* PR shows up in their
event stream with `actor: {{github_login}}` even when someone else clicked the button. If who merged
matters, read `merged_by` from `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/N`.

## Step 3 — Granola meetings

Call `mcp__claude_ai_Granola__list_meetings` with `time_range: "custom"`,
`custom_start` = `START`, `custom_end` = **the day after `END`**, and
`involvement: {captured_by_me: true, listed_as_participant: true}`.

**Dedupe.** The same meeting often appears twice — once captured by them, once by another
attendee. Collapse entries sharing a title and start time.

List title and time only. Do **not** pull transcripts unless explicitly asked; meeting
content is sensitive and a summary line doesn't need it.

**This is context, not output.** Meetings are gathered so the summary can explain a day —
why something moved, stalled, or landed on them. Most runs print none at all. See step 13.

## Step 4 — Outline docs

Call `mcp__claude_ai_Outline__list_documents` with `limit: 25` and no query (returns
recent documents). Do **not** use 100 — that returned 177k chars in testing and blew the
tool-result token cap. Keep documents where **either**:
- `updatedAt` is within `START..END` and `updatedBy.id` is their Outline id, **or**
- `createdAt` is within `START..END` and `createdBy.id` is their Outline id.

**Paginate for anything longer than a day.** The list is workspace-recent across everyone, so
25 rows can cover less than a day in a busy week. Walk `offset` in steps of 25 until the
oldest `updatedAt` on a page is **older than `START`** — that page is the first one that
proves you've gone far enough back. Stop there.

Report title, the `breadcrumb` for context, and the `url`.

Limitation to state honestly if it matters: this is a recency list, not a per-user audit log,
and it only reports the *latest* edit — see step 5's unattributable-edits rule, which covers
Outline too. A doc they edited on Tuesday and a teammate edited on
Friday attributes to the teammate, so their Tuesday work vanishes from a Mon–Fri period. Nothing
in the API fixes that — for a long period, treat Outline as a floor on their doc work, not a
count.

## Step 5 — Google Docs

Call `mcp__claude_ai_Google_Drive__list_recent_files` with `orderBy: "lastModifiedByMe"`,
`pageSize: 25`, `excludeContentSnippets: true`. Keep files whose `modifiedTime` falls within
`START..END`. For a longer period, follow `next_page_token` until a page's `modifiedTime`
values drop below `START`.

Most files in this Drive are `sharedWithMe` and owned by teammates, so "they edited it" is
approximate — the API gives no per-user edit timestamp, and `get_file_metadata` adds nothing
(no `lastModifyingUser`; checked). Prefer files they own, or that the `lastModifiedByMe`
ordering surfaces near the top. Never claim authorship of an edit you cannot attribute.

**Unattributable edits get surfaced, not dropped.** When a file they plausibly worked on was
modified inside the period but the editor can't be established, give it one line saying
exactly that — *"modified Thu 12:42, can't tell from the API whether that was me"* — instead
of omitting it. Two signals make a file plausible: `viewedByMeTime` inside the period, or the
file being the subject of something assigned to them in step 8. Silence reads as "I didn't
touch it", which is a stronger claim than the evidence supports.

The same rule applies to Outline (step 4), which reports only the *latest* editor: if they are in
`collaboratorIds` on a doc whose last edit inside the period belongs to someone else, their own
edit may be hidden underneath it. Surface it the same way, and check `collaboratorIds` before
concluding a doc wasn't their.

## Step 6 — Claude artifacts and design projects

Two claude.ai surfaces. Neither is visible from the repos, and the artifact list does not cover
design projects — so a canvas they shared is invisible to the first call below.

**Artifacts.** Call the `Artifact` tool with `action: "list"`, `limit: 25`, and `scope: "mine"`
— only artifacts they own. Keep the ones whose last-updated date falls within `START..END`.

Report title and URL. Link the title; never paste the bare artifact URL into prose.

Three honest limits:
- The listing gives **last-updated, not created**, so a page they published weeks ago and
  edited inside the period looks identical to one created in it. Write it as "published or
  updated" unless they say which they want — don't assert they created it on this evidence.
- There is no date filter in the call, so filter locally. Newest first, so a day inside the
  most recent 25 is safe; raise the limit toward the **50 cap** for longer periods. 50 is a
  hard ceiling with no pagination — if the 50th artifact is still newer than `START`, the
  period is only partly covered and the summary must say so.
- `scope: "mine"` deliberately excludes artifacts teammates shared with them. Those aren't their
  work and don't belong in their summary.

**Design projects** use the `DesignSync` tool, **read methods only** — a summary never writes,
so `finalize_plan` and everything downstream of it are out of scope here.

`list_projects` returns **design-system projects they can write to, with `updatedAt`**. Filter
those on the period exactly like step 4's docs.

Ordinary multi-artboard canvases are **neither enumerable nor timestamped**, and both halves
bite:
- `list_projects` omits them, so this step can never *discover* a canvas. You only learn one
  exists from another source — a link in Slack (step 8), an Outline doc (step 4), a Linear
  ticket (step 10), a Claude Code prompt (step 11).
- `get_project` and `list_files` give a name and the artboard paths but **no dates at all**.
  Design can never establish that something happened inside the period; the timestamp comes
  from whatever linked it — the Slack message's time, the session's prompt time.

So given a `claude.ai/design/p/<uuid>` URL from another source, resolve it instead of pasting
the uuid: `get_project` for the project name, `list_files` for the `.dc.html` artboards. That
turns a dead link into "the Onboarding Flow Deck, in the Billing Mail UI project", which is the
line worth writing. Name the artboard they actually shared — `_ds/`, `shots/` and `.thumbnail` are
scaffolding, not work.

`canEdit: true` is not authorship, and an artboard existing is not evidence they touched it this
period. Attribute from the linking source, the same standard step 5 uses for Drive files.

The `Artifact` call is a built-in tool rather than MCP, so it and step 11 are the only steps
that survive a headless run. `DesignSync` is built in too but needs the claude.ai login, so
treat it as unavailable there and say so rather than omitting it.

## Step 7 — email

Call `mcp__claude_ai_Gmail__search_threads` twice with `view: "THREAD_VIEW_MINIMAL"` and
`pageSize: 25`. **Both of Gmail's bounds are exclusive**, so widen by a day on each side:
`after:` takes the day *before* `START`, `before:` takes the day *after* `END` (step 1 has
both commands). Dates use slashes here, not dashes:

- What they sent — `in:sent after:2026/08/19 before:2026/08/22`
- What landed for them directly — `to:me after:2026/08/19 before:2026/08/22 -category:promotions -category:social -category:updates -category:forums`

Follow `pageToken` if a long period fills the page; 25 threads is roughly a quiet week.

Report at **subject level only**. A sent mail that decided something, asked a question now
outstanding, or unblocked someone earns a line; a one-line reply does not. Received mail earns a
line when it's provisioning, access, or a decision — most received mail is not their work and does
not belong in a summary of it.

**Do not call `get_thread`.** Subjects plus the snippet the search already returns are enough, and
full bodies are a privacy step-change for a note to themselves. Same principle as the Granola
transcript rule.

**Email is where credentials actually arrive** — invitation links, one-time codes, API keys,
password resets. The no-secrets rule gets tested here rather than in theory. Never reproduce any
of it, and if a subject line itself contains something token-shaped, describe the mail instead of
quoting it: "a WorkOS invitation email", not the subject.

Scope rule still applies: skip threads belonging to `{{exclude_orgs}}`.

## Step 8 — Slack

Two passes: what they said, then what was said to them. Both call
`mcp__claude_ai_Slack__slack_search_public_and_private` with `sort: "timestamp"`,
`include_context: false`, and `only_my_channels: true`.

**Pass A — what they communicated:**

```
from:<@{{chat_destination}}> after:<day before START> before:<day after END> -in:<@{{chat_destination}}>
```

**That trailing exclusion is not optional.** `{{chat_destination}}` is the configured destination — the channel this skill
posts to. Without excluding it, yesterday's summary gets read back as today's activity and the
summary starts summarizing itself.

Angle brackets around IDs are literal in Slack search syntax. Date modifiers are `YYYY-MM-DD`,
and both bounds are exclusive like Gmail's — use the same widened days from step 1. `on:` matches
a single day if you prefer it for a one-day period.

**Search returns at most 20 messages per call.** A single busy day already hit 13, so any period
beyond a couple of days needs the `cursor` from the response followed until it stops. Twenty
results is not "that's all there was".

**Pass B — what was aimed at them:**

```
<@{{chat_destination}}> after:<day before START> before:<day after END> -from:<@{{chat_destination}}> -in:<@{{chat_destination}}>
```

Their bare user ID as a search term matches messages that mention them. `to:` only works for DMs, so
the bare ID is the thing that catches a channel mention. This is where the day's *asks* live: a
question waiting on them, a post-standup to-do list that assigns them work, an access grant landing.
Pass A only shows what they pushed out — without pass B, a question a teammate asked them in a
working channel is invisible, and that is usually the most actionable line in the summary.

**Check pass A before calling anything outstanding.** Most asks get answered within the hour, and
an answered question is not an open item. Match them by thread: the permalinks carry `thread_ts`,
so a reply of their in the same thread is normally the answer.

⚠️ **A thread with no reply is not proof the ask is open.** The usual way a question from a
teammate gets answered is out loud at the next standup, and nothing is ever typed — so the
thread reads unanswered on that day's summary and on every summary after it. Before writing an
*On me* line for an ask, check step 3's meeting list for a meeting between the ask and `END`
with both people in it. Title and time settle this; **do not pull the transcript**, which step 3
forbids for good reason. If one exists, write the line as covered-unless — "a teammate's staging
question, unless the standup covered it" — rather than asserting an open item. Measured
2026-09-15 on the other half of this pair: two asks were answered verbally five minutes after
the queue printed, and both still read as unanswered in Slack.

**A discharged ask is still work, and it is the only work no system records.** Answering three
questions at standup leaves no commit, no ticket and no message. If the meeting is in the
period, that conversation is a summary line in its own right — not an omission to apologize for.

Anything still unanswered, or assigned to them and not done, becomes an *On me* line in step 13 —
unless what they need is from someone else, in which case it is a blocker (step 12).

**Pass C, optional — read the channels this workspace's work happens in**, for a day that
looks thinner than it was. The channel ids come from `{{work_channels}}`; skip pass C entirely
when that key is blank. Read each one with `mcp__claude_ai_Slack__slack_read_channel` and
`response_format: "concise"`.

`oldest`/`latest` are epoch seconds, and they must bound the *local* period — `START` 00:00 to
the day after `END` 00:00:

```bash
date -j -f "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" "$START 00:00:00" +%s          # oldest
date -j -v+1d -f "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" "$END 00:00:00" +%s      # latest
```

`limit` maxes at 100 messages per call, with a `cursor` for more.

This catches what never mentioned them at all — a teammate shipping something they then picked up.
It returns **top-level messages only**; thread replies are collapsed, and that is where most of
the back-and-forth happens, so it complements the two searches rather than replacing them. Volume
on a working channel is usually single digits for a whole day, so it is cheap when you want it.

Report what they actually communicated — a decision, a heads-up, a question they're waiting on — not
chatter. Channel names carry the context, so keep them. Questions they asked that nobody answered
are blocker candidates for step 12.

## Step 9 — calendar

Call `mcp__claude_ai_Google_Calendar__list_events` on their primary calendar with `startTime` =
`START` 00:00 local and `endTime` = the day after `END` at 00:00 local, `orderBy: "startTime"`.
Raise `pageSize` for a long period (max 250) and page through `nextPageToken`.

This closes a real gap rather than duplicating step 3: **Granola only sees meetings that were
recorded.** A meeting they attended without capturing notes is invisible to Granola entirely.

Cross-reference the two. A calendar event with a matching Granola note needs no separate line —
Granola's is better, because it has the content. Report the events that Granola *missed*, and use
calendar to correct the meeting times, since Granola's timestamps are when the note was captured
rather than when the meeting was scheduled.

Two things not to assume: an event on the calendar is not proof they attended, and an accepted invite
is not either. Prefer events they organized or that have a Granola note; if attendance is genuinely
ambiguous, leave it out rather than assert it — the same standard step 5 uses for Drive files.
Declined and cancelled events are not activity.

If the connector is unauthenticated (only `authenticate` / `complete_authentication` exposed), say
so in one line per the honest-gap rule rather than omitting it silently.

## Step 10 — Linear

Skip the step entirely when `{{linear_teams}}` is blank. If the connector is unauthenticated
(only `authenticate` / `complete_authentication` exposed), say so in one line per the
honest-gap rule, the same as step 9.

**Confirm the workspace before reading anything.**
`mcp__claude_ai_Linear__get_workspace` names the Linear workspace the connector is bound to,
and OAuth binds exactly one at a time. A connector pointed at an org in `{{exclude_orgs}}`
will happily return tickets that must not appear in this summary. If it isn't this
workspace's, report that in one line and skip — do not filter your way to a partial answer.

Then resolve identity and scope once:

```
mcp__claude_ai_Linear__list_teams  query: <each of {{linear_teams}}>
mcp__claude_ai_Linear__list_users  query: {{linear_user}}   -> their id AND their display name
```

Keep the **name**, not just the id: `createdBy` and `assignee` come back as display names, so
matching either against an email never hits. `list_users` takes the email as its `query`, which
is what makes that profile key usable at all.

**Two passes per team.** `list_issues` takes `assignee`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `state`,
`label`, `cycle`, `project`, `query`, `team`, `limit`, `fields` and `orderBy`. The date
arguments are **lower bounds only** — "updated after X", no upper bound — so pass `START` to the
API and clip the `END` side yourself:

```
mcp__claude_ai_Linear__list_issues
  team: <team>, assignee: "me", updatedAt: "$START", orderBy: "updatedAt", limit: 50,
  fields: ["title","status","statusType","assignee","createdBy","createdAt","updatedAt",
           "completedAt","startedAt","url","priority","project"]
```

- **Pass A — what they own that moved.** As above. `assignee: "me"` resolves to the connector's
  own identity, so this pass needs no profile value at all.
- **Pass B — what they opened.** Same call with `createdAt: "$START"`, `orderBy: "createdAt"` and
  **no** assignee, then keep rows whose `createdBy` is their name — there is no `createdBy`
  filter, so that match is local. An issue they filed and someone else owns is still their work, and
  the inverse matters more in practice: a burst of issues *assigned* to them that they did not
  create is someone else's planning session, not their output. Say which it was.

`id` is always returned and already carries the identifier (`ACME-708`), so never ask for
`identifier` — it is not a valid field and the call fails with it. Raise `limit` (max 250)
rather than widening `fields`; the field list drives response size, and asking for
`description` across a page is how this step blows the tool-result token cap.

**Prefer the timestamped fields over `updatedAt` for "what moved".** Any teammate's comment or
status change bumps `updatedAt`, so it dates the issue, not their work on it. `completedAt`,
`startedAt` and `canceledAt` say precisely what changed and when. None of them names an actor,
though: a ticket that went Done inside the period may have been closed by anyone, and the API
will not say who. Report the close, not the closer, unless something else establishes it.
`mcp__claude_ai_Linear__list_comments` on that one issue is the only way to find a human in the
loop — worth one call for a ticket that matters, never one per ticket across a team.

**The GitHub overlap is the thing to get right.** Linear links PRs and flips issues to Done on
merge, so a ticket that closed because their PR merged is already reported in step 2 and must not
become a second bullet. A ticket earns a line only for what the PR doesn't say: a status
decision (blocked, descoped, punted to the next cycle), a scope or estimate change, or a
comment thread that settled something. A ticket with no PR behind it is the case where this
step carries the whole item.

Two more calls, worth it for a week or longer and skippable for a day:
- `mcp__claude_ai_Linear__get_status_updates` — `type` is required (`project` or `initiative`)
  and it takes `user: "me"` with a `createdAt` lower bound. A project update they wrote is the
  closest thing to a summary they already authored; prefer their wording to yours.
- `mcp__claude_ai_Linear__list_documents` — Linear docs, filtered the way step 4 filters
  Outline.

**Feed the leftovers forward instead of printing them.** Issues assigned to them and still open
at `END` are *On me* candidates (step 13) — rank them by `priority`, since a page of Todo
tickets is not equally urgent. An issue in a blocked `state`, or one whose latest comment is a
question aimed at them, is a blocker candidate (step 12).

## Step 11 — Claude Code sessions

Every source above records an artifact. This one records intent — what they were trying to do,
what they decided, and the work that produced nothing to point at.

Transcripts are local JSONL, one file per session, in project dirs named after the session
cwd with `/` replaced by `-`. A helper does the extraction. It sits in `scripts/` beside this
file, so build the path from **the skill's own base directory — the one reported when the skill
loads** — never from a fixed location. The skill moves with the plugin that ships it, and any
absolute path under `~/.claude/skills/` is already stale:

```bash
CLAUDE_SESSION_GLOB='{{transcript_glob}}' \
  "<skill base dir>/scripts/claude-code-sessions.sh" "$START" "$END"   # END optional
```

`CLAUDE_SESSION_GLOB` is **required and has no default** — it is the org filter, so the script
refuses to guess rather than silently summarising every workspace on the machine. Pass
`{{transcript_glob}}` exactly. `CLAUDE_PROJECTS_DIR` overrides the transcript root if it has
moved, and `PROMPT_MAXLEN` the 220-char cut.

Per session it prints the auto-generated title, cwd, git branch, short session id, prompt count,
and every human prompt with its local time — sessions ordered by when they started, and a totals
footer. For a multi-day period the time column gains the date automatically, so the output stays
groupable by day. It globs `{{transcript_glob}}` only, so `{{exclude_orgs}}` sessions
never appear — the scope rule holds without extra filtering.

If the script is gone, this is the whole of it. `.origin.kind == "human"` is what separates a
typed prompt from a tool result — both carry `type: "user"`, and tool results outnumber prompts
five to one:

```bash
jq -r --arg s "2026-08-19" --arg e "2026-08-21" '
  select(.type == "user" and .origin.kind == "human" and (.isSidechain != true))
  | (.timestamp | sub("\\.[0-9]+Z$"; "Z") | fromdateiso8601) as $t
  | ($t | strflocaltime("%Y-%m-%d")) as $day
  | select($day >= $s and $day <= $e)
  | ($t | strflocaltime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M")) + "  " + (.message.content
      | if type == "string" then . else (map(select(.type == "text") | .text) | join(" ")) end
      | gsub("\\s+"; " ") | .[0:220])
' ~/.claude/projects/{{transcript_glob}}/*.jsonl
```

**Timestamps are UTC, the day is local.** Do not match the date as a string prefix.
`2026-08-21T01:30Z` is 20:30 on the 20th in CT, so prefix matching files an evening's work
under tomorrow and empties out the evenings. `strflocaltime` is there to do that conversion.

Optional second pass, for a session whose work never reached a commit — the files it edited:

```bash
jq -r 'select(.type == "assistant") | .message.content[]? | select(.type == "tool_use")
  | select(.name == "Edit" or .name == "Write") | .input.file_path // empty' SESSION.jsonl |
  grep -v scratchpad | sort -u
```

**Report the arc, not the prompts.** A busy day is 60+ prompts over four sessions — 6 KB of
text; three days ran to 71 prompts over five sessions. Scale by reading the session headers
first and only descending into the prompts of sessions that matter: for a week or more, the
titles plus prompt counts carry most of the signal, and a 40-prompt session obviously deserves
more attention than a 2-prompt one. One line per session: what they were after and where it
landed. A session already covered
by its PR in step 2 gets nothing here; the PR says it better. Session titles make decent
handles, but a long session wanders far from its title, so trust the prompts over it.

Work on this skill is the exception: sessions that edited this skill's own directory — the
installed plugin copy or any checkout of the repo that ships it — never make the summary, even though they fit everything below. See the hard rules in step 13.

What this source is *for*, and where it beats the others: work that produced no commit, doc, or
artifact; a decision made and then reversed; something tried that didn't work. If a session's
whole story is already in GitHub, this step has nothing to add.

Four limits, all load-bearing:
- **Claude Code only.** Chat and Cowork conversations live server-side with no connector, so
  they are invisible here. Artifacts published from them still surface in step 6 — the
  conversations do not. Never imply the summary covers them.
- **cwd decides inclusion.** A workspace session run from outside `{{workspace_root}}`, or from a worktree
  outside `{{workspace_root}}`, is missed entirely. Set `CLAUDE_SESSION_GLOB` to widen the glob
  if a day looks thinner than it was.
- **Edited-file lists miss Bash writes.** Files written with a heredoc, `sed`, or a script
  leave no tracked edit, so that second pass can come back empty for a session that changed
  plenty.
- **Sessions get resumed and forked**, so an early prompt can appear under two session files.
  Collapse duplicates, the way step 3 collapses Granola meetings.

**Never quote a prompt verbatim.** Prompts are raw typed text, and this step reads more raw
human text than any other. They contain pasted keys, invite links, one-time codes, and the odd
`.env` line. Describe what they were asking for instead. The 220-char cut bounds how much reaches
context; it is a bound, not a scrubber. Same rule as step 7, with more exposure to it.
